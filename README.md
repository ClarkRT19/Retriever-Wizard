# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Retriever Wizard [WIP]
A simple tool to visualize images using premade embeddings and metadata, incl. a small testset of a 1000 images. 

## Overview
Retriever Wizard is a Streamlit tool for AI-based exploration of large image collections. It compares images by using visual similarity (with precomputed embeddings) and provides fast nearest-neighbor search, ranked inspection, annotation marker, and simple 2D projections (UMAP or t-SNE). Typical uses include:
- Exploring thematically similar images
- Spotting gaps and inconsistencies in metadata
- Annotating the images for metadata crossexamination 
- Producing projection plots for research and reporting

It is developed for cross-institutional analysis of educational wall charts and artworks, but applicable to any large-scale image dataset with embeddings.  

## Features
- Metadata validation: checks for a `filename` column (auto-derives from alternatives if possible)
- Embeddings integration: loads premade CLIP/SigLIP/Vision Transformer style CSVs
- File index: builds or loads a CSV map `filename ‚Üí full_path`
- FAISS search: cosine (normalized IP) or L2
- Stacked view: ranked vertical preview with similarity scores and labels.
- Annotation function with csv output
- Projection: UMAP/t-SNE with coloring by (query/nearest/other) or cosine gradient
- Filters: include/exclude per column and optional `pandas.query()` expression
- Image display: multiple backends (Streamlit path, imageio, OpenCV, PIL, raw bytes)
- Checkpointing: save/load app state

## Trying it out
The app.py is naturally set up to run the testset in the Examples folder, try out the testset or change embeddings, metadata and images to your own. 
**Important notes**: The column: *filename* is central to the code and is what FAISS indexes the images after, and is the link between metadata, images and embeddings. All image-names must be different, and you can't use the same named columns. 

## Installation (Windows)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClarkRT19/retriever-wizard.git
cd retriever-wizard

py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
# If needed:
pip install faiss-cpu umap-learn scikit-learn plotly imageio pillow opencv-python
```

## Running Retriever Wizard:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
